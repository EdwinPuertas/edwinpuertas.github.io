abstract={The adoption of photovoltaic (PV) systems has increased significantly in recent years, driven by the demand for off-grid and on-grid residential and commercial applications. However, the high initial investment required for PV installations has limited their widespread adoption. Governments and marketing enterprises have implemented different strategies to promote PV systems to overcome this barrier, focusing on the return on investment (ROI) concept. However, the conventional approach uses limited economic factors to calculate the ROI. It fails to consider the impact of external factors, such as system degradation, which can vary between systems. To address this issue, we propose a new methodology to estimate the ROI of a photovoltaic system with greater accuracy. Our approach incorporates system-predicted degradation, calculated using historical meteorological data and prediction techniques. We applied this methodology to a photovoltaic system installed at the Universidad Tecnologica de Bolivar (UTB) in Cartagena and evaluated it against five different approaches. The results show that our proposed method offers a more accurate and reliable estimation of the ROI of a photovoltaic system, considering a broader range of factors. Overall, our work contributes to advancing the understanding of photovoltaic system ROI calculation and promotes using sustainable energy sources. By providing a more precise estimation of the ROI of a photovoltaic system, our methodology can help potential investors make more informed decisions and promote the adoption of clean energy sources. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a semi-automated, scalable, and homologous methodology towards IoT implemented in Python for extracting and integrating images in pedestrian and motorcyclist areas on the road for constructing a multiclass object classifier. It consists of two stages. The first stage deals with creating a non-debugged data set by acquiring images related to the semantic context previously mentioned, using an embedded device connected 24/7 via Wi-Fi to a free and public CCTV service in Medellin, Colombia. Through artificial vision techniques, and automatically performs a comparative chronological analysis to download the images observed by 80 cameras that report data asynchronously. The second stage proposes two algorithms focused on debugging the previously obtained data set. The first one facilitates the user in labeling the data set not debugged through Regions of Interest (ROI) and hotkeys. It decomposes the information in the nth image of the data set in the same dictionary to store it in a binary Pickle file. The second one is nothing more than an observer of the classification performed by the user through the first algorithm to allow the user to verify if the information contained in the Pickle file built is correct. © 2023 The Author(s)},

abstract={Social networks are now integral to modern life, offering instant global communication. Unfortunately, this ease of connectivity has also led to the misuse of freedom, with many social media users expressing inappropriate and often sexist comments. In response, the field of natural language processing has actively sought solutions to detect and counteract such content. Our study builds upon our previous work presented during the SemEval 2023 competition. Initial results, achieved using only lexical features, prompted a thorough reevaluation. Recognizing the potential of advanced techniques, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration to enhance our approach. Leveraging our experience, we focused on a feature union strategy. By seamlessly combining the 'twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest' transformer model with established lexical features, we developed a refined methodology that transcends the limitations of individual elements. This approach improved performance and demonstrated the synergistic potential of merging these distinct features. Our improved method revealed significant enhancements, underscoring the effectiveness of our methodology in boosting detection capabilities. It led to a notable improvement of approximately 20% in binary classification accuracy, a substantial leap from our previous results. The strategic blend of linguistic and transformer-based features emerged as the driving force behind this significant advancement. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are the engine of economic, environmental, and social stability in many countries but recently MSMEs have been facing instability in their sales and, production, and feature a decrease in employment that generates negative growth in the gross domestic product in emerging countries. Also, along with governmental entities, they are expected to be aware of the importance of developing sustainable models to improve production systems within the framework of sustainable development. Considering there is abundant literature on multiple sustainable models, their effective implementation in production systems is a debate topic as there is no standard guide to the processes and activities that should be followed in their adoption. The objective of this study is to design an integral sustainability model for MSMEs through the analysis of the interrelationships and dependencies of sustainability factors and a perception analysis evaluating 327 MSMEs in Colombia, using the design science research and case study as a research method. The analysis of the results has been exposed as results of a doctoral thesis which indicates that the MSMEs that were studied presented significant variations and similarities in the use of the adoption of sustainable strategies, which allowed the identification of weaknesses and strengths to focus efforts on the development of productive systems aligned with environmental sustainability. © 2023 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

abstract={Objectives: Our study compares two national COVID-19 vaccination plan strategies—high-risk prioritization and no prioritization—and estimates their cost-effectiveness compared with no vaccination, to generate possible recommendations for future vaccination plans. Methods: We developed a Markov discrete-time, compartmental, deterministic model stratified by Colombian departments, healthcare workers, comorbidities, and age groups and calibrated to seroprevalence, cases, and deaths. The model simulates three scenarios: no vaccination, no prioritization of vaccination, and prioritization of high-risk population. The study presents the perspective of the health system of Colombia, including the direct health costs financed by the government and the direct health outcomes related to the infection. We measured symptomatic cases, deaths, and costs for each of the three scenarios from the start of the vaccination rollout to February 20, 2023. Results: Both for the base-case and across multiple sensitivity analyses, the high-risk prioritization proves to be the most cost-effective of the considered strategies. An increment of US$255 million results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$3339 per disability-adjusted life-year avoided. The simulations show that prioritization of high-risk population reduces symptomatic cases by 3.4% and deaths by 20.1% compared with no vaccination. The no-prioritization strategy is still cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$5223.66, but the sensitivity analysis the show potential risks of losing cost-effectiveness under the cost-effectiveness threshold (one gross domestic product per averted disability-adjusted life-year). Conclusions: The high-risk prioritization strategy is consistently more cost-effective than the no-prioritization strategy across multiple scenarios. High-risk prioritization is the recommended strategy in low-resource settings to reduce the burden of disease. © 2022 International Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research},

abstract={A maturity model for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is introduced to assess the level of implementation of sustainability strategies and practices in this type of business. According to the literature, only a few sustainability-maturity assessment models intended for MSMEs have integrated the following three factors: environmental knowledge management, environmental strategies and good practices, and environmental management systems. The sustainability maturity model proposed here for MSMEs is capable of supporting the efforts of companies in their attempts to achieve both environmental sustainability and an improvement in their production systems. The model encompasses a four-level qualitative scale and uses supervised classification algorithms to categorize companies through data analysis techniques. After applying the model to a group of MSMEs from different productive sectors in Colombia, the results have shown that 6% of the companies were at an insufficient level, 31% were at an initial level, 45% at a developed sustainability maturity level, and 18% at a consolidated level. This result implies that the decision makers in the latter group have paid greater attention to the strengthening of sustainability progress capabilities and, hence, to the definition of a maturation route. © 2021},

abstract={The emergence of digital social networks has transformed society, social groups, and institutions in terms of the communication and expression of their opinions. Determining how language variations allow the detection of communities, together with the relevance of specific vocabulary (proposed by the National Council of Accreditation of Colombia (Consejo Nacional de Acreditación - CNA) to determine the quality evaluation parameters for universities in Colombia) in digital assemblages could lead to a better understanding of their dynamics and social foundations, thus resulting in better communication policies and intervention where necessary. The approach presented in this paper intends to determine what are the semantic spaces (sociolinguistic features) shared by social groups in digital social networks. It includes five layers based on Design Science Research, which are integrated with Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The approach is validated through a case study wherein the semantic values of a series of “Twitter” institutional accounts belonging to Colombian Universities are analyzed in terms of the 12 quality factors established by CNA. In addition, the topics and the sociolect used by different actors in the university communities are also analyzed. The current approach allows determining the sociolinguistic features of social groups in digital social networks. Its application allows detecting the words or concepts to which each actor of a social group (university) gives more importance in terms of vocabulary. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Nowadays, hate messages have become the object of study on social media. Efficient and effective detection of hate profiles requires various scientific disciplines, such as computational linguistics and sociology. Here, we illustrate how we used lexical and phonetic features to determine if the author spreads hate speech. This article presents a novel strategy for the characterization of the Twitter profile based on the generation of lexical and phonetic user features that serve as input to a set of classifiers. The results are part of our participation in the PAN 2021 in the CLEF in the task of Profiling Hate Speech Spreaders on Twitter. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

abstract={The explosive growth of fake news on social networks has aroused great interest from researchers in different disciplines. To achieve efficient and effective detection of fake news requires scientific contributions from various disciplines, such as computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and sociology. Here we illustrate how polarity, emotion, and user statistics can be used to detect fake profiles on Twitter’s social network. This paper presents a novel strategy for the characterization of the Twitter profile based on the generation of an assembly of polarity, emotion, and user statistics characteristics that serve as input to a set of classifiers.

abstract={Social networks have been a revolutionary scenario for celebrities because they allow them to reach a wider audience with much higher frequency than using traditional means. These platforms enable them to improve or sometimes deteriorate, their careers through the construction of closer relationships with their fans and the acquisition of new ones. Indeed, networks have promoted the emergence of a new type of celebrities that exists only in the digital world. Being able to characterize the celebrities that are more active on social networks, such as Twitter, gives an enormous opportunity to identify what is their real level of fame, what is their relevance for an age group, or a specific gender or occupation. These facts may enrich decision making, especially in advertising and marketing. To achieve this aim, this paper presents a novel strategy for the characterization of celebrities profile on Twitter based on the generation of socio-linguistic features from their posts that serve as input to a set of classifiers. Specifically, we produced four classifiers that describe the level of fame, the gender, the birth date, and the possible occupation of a celebrity. We obtained the training and test data sets as part of our participation at PAN 2019 at CLEF. Results of each classifier are reported including the analysis of which features are more relevant, which classification techniques were more useful and which were the final precision and recall results. © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Unfortunately, in social networks, software bots or just bots are becoming more and more common because malicious people have seen their usefulness to spread false messages, spread rumors and even manipulate public opinion. Even though the text generated by users in social networks is a rich source of information that can be used to identify different aspects of its authors, not being able to recognize which users are truly humans and which are not, is a big drawback. In this work, we describe the properties of our multilingual classification model submitted for PAN2019 that is able to recognize bots from humans, and females from males. This solution extracted 18 features from the user's posts and applying a machine learning algorithm obtained good performance results. © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={A corpus is an indispensable linguistic resource for any application of natural language processing. Some corpora have been created manually or semi-automatically for a specific domain. In this paper, we present an automatic approach to generate corpus from digital information sources such as Wikipedia and web pages. The information extracted by Wikipedia is done by delimiting the domain, using a propagation algorithm to determine the categories associated with a domain region and a set of seeds to delimit the search. The information extracted from the web pages is carried out efficiently, determining the patterns associated with the structure of each page with the purpose of defining the quality of the extraction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={Text classification or text categorization in social networks such as Twitter has taken great importance with the growth of applications of this process in diverse domains of society. Literature about text classifiers is significantly wide especially in languages such as English; however, this is not the case for age classification whose studies have been mainly focused on image recognition and analysis. This paper presents the results of testing linear classifiers performance in the task of identifying Twitter users age from their profile descriptions and tweets. For this purpose, a Spanish Lexicon of 45 words around the concept "cumpleaños" was created and the Gold Standard of 1541 users with age correctly identified was obtained. The experiments are presented with the description of the algorithms used to finally obtain the best seven models that permit to identify the user's age with accuracy results between 66% and 69 %. Considering the information-retrieval layer, the new results showed that accuracy was increased from 69,09% to 72,96%. Copyright © 2018 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.
